| content-based filtering | Uses similarity between items to recommend items similar to what the user likes. | If user A watches two cute cat videos, then the system can recommend cute animal videos to that user. |
| collaborative filtering | Uses similarities between queries and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. | If user A is similar to user B, and user B likes video 1, then the system can recommend video 1 to user A (even if user A hasnâ€™t seen any videos similar to video 1). |
